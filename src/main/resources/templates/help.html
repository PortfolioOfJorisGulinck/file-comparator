                <p>On the first page you get the option to upload two csv files. These files will be validated whether
                    they contain the
                    correct data. For example, the file should contain the following headers:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>ProfileName</li>
                    <li>TransactionDate</li>
                    <li>TransactionAmount</li>
                    <li>TransactionNarrative</li>
                    <li>TransactionDescription</li>
                    <li>TransactionID</li>
                    <li>TransactionType</li>
                    <li>WalletReference</li>
                </ul>
                <p>You can find two example csv files in the directory ./files</p>

                <img th:src="@{/img/second-page-summary.png}" alt="second page summary"/>
                <p>On the second page you can find the summary of the comparison between de data of both files. You wil
                    be provided with
                    following data:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Total records</li>
                    <li>Matching records</li>
                    <li>Unmatched records</li>
                    <li>Number of duplicates</li>
                </ul>
                <img th:src="@{/img/second-page-overview.png}" alt="second page overview"/>
                <p>Then you can go to the unmatched report, which contains all the transactions that did not match. This
                    is a unique list
                    where the duplicates were removed. For this comparison all properties where used.</p>
                <p>When you look for a specific match between a transaction, visible in the unmatched report, you can go
                    to the 'Search'
                    link. This wil bring you to the third page.</p>

            <section>
                <h3 class="mt-3">Fuzzy comparing page</h3>
                <img th:src="@{/img/third-page.png}" alt="third page"/>
                <p>On this page you find a table with transactions that matches the given transaction you searched for.
                    Here
                    a broader search
                    algorithm is used so that transactions with slightly different data can be compared. The table
                    provides
                    a 'ratio' score,
                    which means that how closer the ratio gets to 100, the more accurately the transactions match.</p>
                <p>For the broader search the <a href="https://github.com/xdrop/fuzzywuzzy">FuzzyWuzzy</a> library is
                    used.
                    This is a fuzzy string
                    matching alghoritm for java based on the FuzzyWuzzy Python algorithm. The algorithm uses Levenshtein
                    distance to calculate
                    similarity between strings.</p>
                <p>Different searching strategies can be applied. You can search the results with the following
                    strategies:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Simple Ratio:</b> the Simple Ratio function compares two strings by measuring the difference between
                        two
                        sequences. For
                        this it uses the Levenshtein distance algorithm.
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Partial Ratio:</b> the problem with the Simple Ratio function is that inconsistent substrings
                        sometimes
                        give an unjustified
                        low score. To get around it, you can use the Partial Ratio or best partial algorithm, when two
                        strings are of noticeably
                        different lengths.
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Token Sort Ratio &amp; Token Sort Partial Ratio:</b> The problem with the Simple Ratio &amp; Partial
                        Ratio function is that not
                        only inconsistent substrings give an unjustified low score, but we also have to deal with
                        differences in string construction.
                        To get around it, you can use the Token Sort Ratio algorithm. The token sort approach involves
                        tokenizing the string in
                        question, sorting the tokens alphabetically, and then joining them back into a string. Then it
                        compares the transformed
                        strings with a Simple Ratio or Partial Ratio.
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Token Set Ratio &amp; Token Set Partial Ratio:</b> The token set approach is similar, but a little
                        bit
                        more flexible. Here, it
                        tokenizes both strings, but instead of immediately sorting and comparing, it splits the tokens
                        into
                        two groups:
                        intersection and remainder. It uses those sets to build up a comparison string. Then it compares
                        the
                        transformed strings
                        with a Simple Ratio or Partial Ratio.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>You can also choose which ratio the matching result must meet in order to be displayed in the
                    table.</p>
                <p>The first time you enter the third page, by default you will be provided with transactions that where
                    searched with
                    the Simple Ratio at a ratio of 80.</p>
                <p>For all searching strategies, all properties are calculated equal. You can call this a more
                    pessimistic
                    approach, but
                    this way you do not miss any data that has different values.</p>
